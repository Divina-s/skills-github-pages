Hello everyone,

My name is Divina Mbel, and I am a data science student with a passion for solving complex problems using data. Today marks the beginning of my blogging journey where I plan to share my experiences, projects, and insights as I dive deeper into the world of data science.

Why Data Science?
The world around us is increasingly driven by data. From healthcare and finance to agriculture and entertainment, data science has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve lives. My interest in data science stems from a desire to harness this power and contribute to meaningful projects that can make a difference.
